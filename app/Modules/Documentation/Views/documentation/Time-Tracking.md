### Creating a Project

Time tracking starts with creating a project.
Click the Time Tracking link from the left-hand navigation menu.

Press the Create Project button.

Provide a name for the project, start typing the client name and select
the name from the dropdown, and set the hourly rate and due date for the
project. Press the Save button when done.

### Managing Timers

Now that we have some tasks added, we can start timers on one or more
tasks by pressing the green Start Timer button for the appropriate
task(s).

\* Note: Running tasks will continue to run even if you log out of
BillingTrack or close your browser.

Timers can be manually added or deleted to a task by clicking the Show
Timers icon.

Any timers currently associated with the task will be listed here.

To manually add a timer, click the calendar icon, choose the start date
and end date along with the start time and end time and press the Apply
button.

### Billing Tasks

When you're ready to bill for the time tracked on a task, press the Bill
Task icon. Alternatively, multiple tasks may be billed at once by
selecting each of the tasks to be billed and pressing the Bulk Actions
button and selecting Bill Tasks.

Tasks can be billed to a new invoice or to an existing invoice.
Selecting the appropriate options and pressing the Submit button will
add the tasks as line items to an invoice.

Once tasks have been billed, they will appear under the Billed Tasks
area.
